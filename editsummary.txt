=====================================
IMAGE VALIDATION BUG FIX
=====================================
Date: October 28, 2025

ISSUE IDENTIFIED
----------------
❌ 500 Internal Server Error when uploading ads
❌ Error: "Failed to validate image. Please try again."
❌ Image validation middleware was failing

ROOT CAUSE
----------
The original image validation middleware was:
1. Fetching the image from Cloudinary via HTTPS
2. Downloading the entire image buffer
3. Using the image-size package to parse dimensions

This approach was:
- Complex and error-prone
- Inefficient (downloading full images)
- Causing validation failures

FIX IMPLEMENTED
---------------
✓ Simplified validation to use Cloudinary API directly
✓ Changed from manual image download + parsing
✓ Now uses cloudinary.api.resource(publicId) to get metadata
✓ Gets width and height directly from Cloudinary's response
✓ More reliable and efficient
✓ Removed unused image-size package dependency

CODE CHANGES
------------
File: server/middleware/imageValidation.js

BEFORE:
- Used image-size + https to download and parse
- Required: image-size package
- Complex buffer handling

AFTER:
- Uses Cloudinary API: cloudinary.api.resource()
- Gets dimensions from API response
- Simpler, faster, more reliable
- No extra dependencies needed

TESTING
-------
✓ Server restarted successfully
✓ Image validation now uses Cloudinary API
✓ Should handle all image uploads correctly
✓ Better error messages with actual dimensions

The ad creation system should now work properly for uploading images.

RENDER DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION (October 30, 2025)
===================================================

SINGLE SERVICE DEPLOYMENT
-------------------------
Updated server.js to support monolithic deployment where the Express backend
serves the built React app as static files in production.

server/server.js Changes:
- Added path module import
- Added production check: if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production')
- Serves static files from build/ folder
- Catch-all route returns index.html for React Router support
- Development mode still returns 404 JSON for API-only behavior

RENDER CONFIGURATION FOR ONE SERVICE
-------------------------------------
Service Type: Web Service

Build Command:
  npm install && npm run build

Start Command:
  npm run server:prod

Environment Variables Required:
  NODE_ENV=production
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://james_db_user:Au3IcopQekm2lqd4@crunchperks.5qlhpfu.mongodb.net/?appName=CrunchPerks
  JWT_SECRET=f6fa0734f573da631094f7d904a2fcde7bf44c20afa7e8820f290f0afca31f43
  CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dbx0s2qsy
  CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=659968855931844
  CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=xCrLN6ekyhv-ig9b3n6gxI9XDq4

How It Works:
1. Build phase: npm install downloads all dependencies, npm run build creates
   optimized React production build in build/ folder
2. Start phase: npm run server:prod starts Express server with NODE_ENV=production
3. Express serves built React app for all routes except /api/*
4. API routes (/api/auth, /api/applications, /api/ads) handled by backend
5. All other routes serve index.html to support React Router client-side routing

Benefits:
- Single service = lower cost
- Simpler deployment and management
- No CORS issues (same origin)
- Automatic API routing

DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE
-----------------------
Before: Considered two-service architecture (separate frontend/backend)
After: Single-service monolithic architecture (backend serves frontend)

This change was made in response to user question about why different commands
were needed for frontend and backend when only one Render service exists.


NODE VERSION FIX FOR RENDER (October 30, 2025)
==============================================

ISSUE: Build Failure on Render
-------------------------------
Error: "sh: 1: react-scripts: not found"
Cause: Render defaulted to Node.js 22.16.0, which has compatibility issues
       with react-scripts 5.0.1

SOLUTION:
---------
1. Added engines field to package.json:
   - Node.js: >=18.0.0 <21.0.0 (LTS versions)
   - npm: >=9.0.0

2. Created .node-version file:
   - Explicitly specifies Node.js 20.18.0 (LTS)
   - Render will detect this file and use the specified version

COMPATIBILITY NOTES:
--------------------
- react-scripts 5.0.1 is not compatible with Node.js 22
- Node.js 18 and 20 are LTS (Long Term Support) versions
- React 19.2.0 requires careful consideration for production use
- These changes ensure stable builds on Render


API URL FIX FOR PRODUCTION (October 30, 2025)
=============================================

ISSUE: CORS Error on Production
--------------------------------
Error: "Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/api/auth/partner/login' 
       from origin 'https://crunchperks.onrender.com' has been blocked by CORS"

Cause: Frontend built into production was still trying to call localhost API
       URLs instead of using relative URLs for same-origin requests.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
- API_BASE_URL in src/utils/api.js defaulted to 'http://localhost:5000/api'
- AdCreator.js used process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL directly
- REACT_APP_API_URL wasn't set in Render, so it fell back to localhost
- Production build "baked in" the localhost URL

SOLUTION:
---------
1. Changed API_BASE_URL default from 'http://localhost:5000/api' to '/api'
2. Exported API_BASE_URL from api.js for reuse
3. Updated AdCreator.js to import and use API_BASE_URL
4. This ensures production uses relative URLs (same-origin, no CORS)
5. Development still works because .env sets REACT_APP_API_URL

Files Changed:
--------------
src/utils/api.js:
  - Changed: const API_BASE_URL = ... to export const API_BASE_URL = ...
  - Default changed from 'http://localhost:5000/api' to '/api'
  
src/components/dashboard/AdCreator.js:
  - Added import: API_BASE_URL from '../../utils/api'
  - Changed fetch URL from process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL to API_BASE_URL

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
-----------------
Development (npm run dev):
  - .env sets REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
  - Frontend on :3000 calls backend on :5001
  - Works with separate dev servers

Production (Render):
  - REACT_APP_API_URL not set (undefined)
  - Falls back to '/api' (relative URL)
  - Same-origin requests to https://crunchperks.onrender.com/api
  - No CORS issues
